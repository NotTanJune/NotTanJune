## Hi there 👋

I’m [Tanmay](www.tanmaynargas.engineer), a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence at NTU, based in Singapore. I tinker with robotics, machine vision, and anything that lets me teach a machine to see, think, or move. I build things that solve real problems - or at least teach me something useful while failing spectacularly the first dozen times.

# Fun facts

- I enjoy building physical projects (robotics / mechatronics) and bringing ML into the loop.  
- I own a Nintendo Switch but end up playing on PC/Steam more of the time.
- I love cycling, swimming, and playing basketball.
- I've been playing the guitar for more than a decade and find great solace in doing so, in my free time.
