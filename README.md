## Hi there 👋

I’m [Tanmay](www.tanmaynargas.engineer), a Master's stdent in Artificial Intelligence at NTU, based in Singapore. I tinker with robotics, machine vision, and anything that lets me teach a machine to see, think, or move. I build things that solve real problems — or at least teach me something useful while failing spectacularly the first dozen times.

# About me

- Background: Bachelor's in Mechatronics; ~2 years of industry experience.  
- Current focus: Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence — coursework & hands-on projects in ML, deep learning, and generative AI.  
- Tech strengths: Python, AWS, machine learning fundamentals, and practical experience with hardware + embedded workflows from mechatronics.  
- Work style: Hack-first — prototype fast, iterate, and ship the useful bits.


# What I build / care about

- Responsive web apps/mobile apps that usually solve a problem I've encountered in the past.
- Prototypes and projects that combine hardware and ML (robotics + vision).
- Tools and automation to make development less boring and more repeatable.

# Currently

- Pursuing my Master’s in AI and building projects in GenAI / ML.  
- Preparing for internships / early-career roles in ML / DevOps / cloud-focused engineering.

---

# Open to

- Internships, collaborative projects, mentorship conversations, and coffee-fuelled debugging sessions.  
- If you want to work together: reach out - happy to chat about ML, infra automation, or clever engineering problems.

# Fun facts & personal things (placeholders)

- I enjoy building physical projects (robotics / mechatronics) and bringing ML into the loop.  
- I own a Nintendo Switch but end up playing on PC/Steam more of the time.
- I love cycling, swimming, and playing basketball.
- I've been playing the guitar for more than a decade and find great solace in doing so, in my free time.
